Hello! I'm a passionate student eagerly anticipating the start of my college journey next year. I have a voracious appetite for learning and thrive on the excitement of exploring new realms of knowledge. Proficient in Python, I find joy in coding and problem-solving, and I'm thrilled at the prospect of delving deeper into the world of programming. As a budding enthusiast in 3D design, I've embarked on my journey with Blender, relishing the creative process and pushing my boundaries to bring ideas to life visually. Additionally, I'm venturing into the realm of databases, with a foundational understanding of MySQL. My eagerness to embrace challenges and absorb new information propels me forward, and I'm excited to see where my academic endeavors will take me.
